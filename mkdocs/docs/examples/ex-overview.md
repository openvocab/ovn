# Examples Overview

**The examples are not up to date with recent VF specification changes, they will be updated soon. **

The examples section contains [yaml](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-yaml) files that are snippets of sample data for some of the functions Valueflows supports.  They aim to add concreteness and detail for people who are exploring the depths of Valueflows, or designing or coding applications or APIs based on Valueflows.

Each yaml file is accompanied by a diagram to give an overview of the structure.  The color coded layers of the diagrams correspond to [this base model](../../introduction/core/#levels-of-the-ontology).

*Note:* The data is often incomplete, missing dates or other information, to try to keep the examples simpler, and more pointed towards the issue at hand.  So it could be helpful to skim across different examples.

*Note:* Some of the examples contain alternate valid data structures for [relationships with inverses](../../specification/uml/#inverse-terms) (definitions in both directions), particularly the Production section.
