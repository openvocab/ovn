# Examples Overview

The examples section contains [yaml](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-yaml) files that are snippets of sample data for some of the functions Valueflows supports.  They aim to add concreteness and detail for people who are exploring the depths of Valueflows, or designing or coding applications or APIs based on Valueflows.

Each yaml file is accompanied by a diagram to give an overview of the structure.  The color coded layers of the diagrams correspond to [this base model](../../introduction/core/#levels-of-the-ontology).  The diagrams are not meant to be data models, they are meant to be a sort of flow model, with directionality representing how things happen, not data relationships.

The example sections are ordered so they generally build on previous example sections.

*Note:* The data is often incomplete, to try to keep the examples simpler, and pointed towards the issue at hand.  So it could be helpful to skim across different examples.
