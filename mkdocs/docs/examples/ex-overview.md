# Examples Overview

**Note: Due to recent spec changes, some of these examples are being updated.  If you need something, please contact us in [the matrix VF Welcome chat](https://matrix.to/#/#valueflows:matrix.org).**

The examples section contains [yaml](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-yaml) files that are snippets of sample data for some of the functions Valueflows supports.  They aim to add concreteness and detail for people who are exploring the depths of Valueflows, or designing or coding applications or APIs based on Valueflows.

Each yaml file is accompanied by a diagram to give an overview of the structure.  The color coded layers of the diagrams correspond to [this base model](../introduction/core/#levels-of-the-ontology).

*Note:* The data is often incomplete, missing dates or other information, to try to keep the examples simpler, and more pointed towards the issue at hand.
