## REA (Resources, Events, Agents)

The REA ontology is the main basis for the Valueflows model.  Here is some background.

[Bill McCarthy's list of REA papers](https://www.williamemccarthy.com/)

[McCarthy's original 1982 REA paper](../linked-docs/REA+Accounting+Model_A+Generalized+Framework+for+Accounting+Systems+in+a+Shared+Data+Environment_1982.pdf)

[REA ontology paper](../linked-docs/The+Ontological+Foundations+of+REA+Enterprise+Information+Systems_2000.pdf)

Extending REA from internal business systems into larger economic networks:

[Radically Distributed Supply Chain Systems](http://www.jeffsutherland.org/oopsla97/haugen.html)

[A semantic model for Internet supply chain collaboration](../linked-docs/REA_+A+Semantic+Model+for+Internet+Supply+Chain+Collaboration_2000.pdf) a little dated and most of the internal links are broken, but still useful

ISO Accounting and Economic Ontology based on REA. 

International Standards Organization, [“ISO 15944-4: Information Technology – Business Operational View – Part 4: Business Transaction Scenarios – Accounting and Economic Ontology,” Second Version of International Standard, The International Organization for Standards (ISO), Geneva, Switzerland, April 2015](https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/).

## IPO (Input-Process-Output)

Merged into the REA pattern, is the [IPO pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPO_model), which is used in many fields of study and analysis. IPO use for [Material Flow Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_flow_analysis) is almost the same as we use it in Valueflows.

## Dependent Demand

We do event-driven Resource Requirements Planning based on that pattern.  [Dependent Demand - a Business Pattern](../linked-docs/dependent_demand.pdf)

## REA and Climate

REA (and Valueflows) works very well for climate analysis and accounting, see [Accounting for Planetary Survival](../linked-docs/AccountingForPlanetarySurvival_defx-2.pdf), especially *Resources - Events - Agents (REA): An accounting system for networked cooperation and shared supply chains* starting on pg. 85; and *Appendix I: From private ownership accounting to commons accounting*.
