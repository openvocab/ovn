# Event Resource Logic

All economic information in an Economic Resource must be put there by an Economic Event.  Non-economic information (note, image, etc.) can be updated on the Economic Resource directly. Economic information is anything that might affect periodic accounting or financial reporting.  In this way, there is always an immutable detailed time-based record of information that affected such reporting.

For detailed information on this logic, please see [Actions](../concepts/actions.md).
