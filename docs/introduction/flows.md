# Flows

Flows come as fundamental construct in ValueFlows ontology. When put in chronological order, they form a progression:

1. Intents which can lead to Commitments
2. Commitments which can lead to Economic Events

## Intent

On the process side, for example, a work plan could be an Intent, but a work plan that some agent committed to is a Commitment.
Intent describes some potential future event which might require prior Commitment.

## Commitment

Commitments are "mirrors" of economic events, and economic events can fulfull commitments. Commitments can be considered contractual promises from one agent to another.
Commitments describe potential future event which involved agents already agreed to pursuit.

## Economic Events

Economic event describes past event, something already observed, never some potential future event.

## Timeline, plans and observations

Figure below shows that Economic Events have to be observed and for that reason only appear as records of the past. Future plans get represented with Intents and Commitments.

## Matching Intents

Often agents will start their plans independently and record their initial intents. Later once they make a Commitment with other agent, it will represent a specific shared part of their plans. For that reason any Commitment can result in Satisfaction of providing agent's Intent as well as Satisfaction of receiving agent Intent.

## Granularity

Intents, Commitments, and Economic Events can occur at any granularity that is needed or for which data can be obtained.  So they primarily are used for all operational needs, but can also be used at higher levels for analytical and high level planning needs for communities or regions, for example.
