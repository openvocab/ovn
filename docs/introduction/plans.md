# Plans

A plan is a logical collection of processes and/or transfers that constitute a body of planned work with defined deliverable(s).  A plan normally contains one or more process and/or transfer resource flows, one for each deliverable.

Processes in a plan can be part of different scopes, if the different scopes are tightly coordinated with pre-agreed rules, for example sub-organizations of a main organization, or working together in an ongoing tightly coordinated supply chain that doesn't require new decisions.  If not, or if the agents prefer, then inputs from another scope should become deliverables for that scope's plan.  Different batch sizes could trigger a new plan for inputs to the main deliverable too.  But all of this does not affect the vocabulary or model.  Plans can relate to each other through resource flows just like Processes.

Plans are used for understanding and coordinating what needs to happen for specific outputs. The size and complexity of a Plan is up to the people who are planning and coordinating the work.

A Plan can be generated from a Recipe.

Some examples:

* A communications group publishes posts for the larger group.  The communications group needs some of their posts translated into various languages.

* An organization decides to mount a campaign for some objective.  There might be many different deliverables: a fundraising website, some brochures, some events, etc.  All of these can be part of the same plan for easier coordination.  For example, a campaign logo could be used in all of these separate outputs.

* An organization gets an order for something they produce.  They can create a plan to produce to that order.  Or they can gather all the orders for a time period for that item and produce to that as a larger plan.  Or they can produce a standard batch size to stock, in anticipation of orders.
