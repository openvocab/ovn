# Provenance

Provenance is a form of tracing the origins of some end state. The term is often used for scientific papers or for valuable assets like artworks or diamonds.

From [PROV Overview](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/): "Provenance is information about entities, activities, and people involved in producing a piece of data or thing, which can be used to form assessments about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness." Provenance traces the history of an artifact, its processes and inputs, their processes and inputs, etc.

Provenance goes backward from the end of a flow, just like value equations.
