# REA

Background of the REA (Resource, Event, Agent) model which this software is based on:

[Bill McCarthy's REA papers](https://www.williamemccarthy.com/)

[McCarthy's original 1982 REA paper](https://www.williamemccarthy.com/s/REA-Accounting-Model_A-Generalized-Framework-for-Accounting-Systems-in-a-Shared-Data-Environment_198.pdf)

[REA ontology paper](https://www.williamemccarthy.com/s/The-Ontological-Foundations-of-REA-Enterprise-Information-Systems_2000.pdf)

[Singapore REA Learning Tool](http://smu.sg/rea)

Extending REA from internal business systems into larger economic networks:

[A semantic model for Internet supply chain collaboration](http://mikorizal.org/REA_+A+Semantic+Model+for+Internet+Supply+Chain+Collaboration_2000.pdf) a little dated and most of the internal links are broken, but still useful

ISO Accounting and Economic Ontology based on REA

International Standards Organization, [“ISO 15944-4: Information Technology – Business Operational View – Part 4: Business Transaction Scenarios – Accounting and Economic Ontology,” Second Version of International Standard, The International Organization for Standards (ISO), Geneva, Switzerland, April 2015](https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/).  (Link connects reader to request for free copy of certain ISO standards; reader then chooses to ask for 15944-4-2015.)

Besides REA, the other main core concept is dependent demand. We do event-driven Resource Requirements Planning based on that pattern.
