### Turtle Reference

For the current rdf turtle file reference, [click here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valueflows/valueflows/master/release-doc-in-process/all_vf.TTL).  This also covers only the ValueFlows namespace.  For other rdf elements that are needed for the complete vocabulary, see [External Terms](https://valueflo.ws/specification/external-terms.html).

### Complete References

For a complete reference, see the [UML diagram](https://valueflo.ws/specification/diagrams/uml.html), which also documents the appropriate rdf namespace for each element.  Also the [graphql reference](https://github.com/valueflows/vf-graphql/tree/master/lib/schemas) includes the entire vocabulary in a non-rdf format, as does the [json-schema reference](https://github.com/valueflows/vf-json-schema/tree/master/schemas).
