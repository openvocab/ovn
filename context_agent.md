## Context Agents

A context agent is a specific role of an agent, in addition to other general roles it plays as an economic agent. 
An agent that is a context agent is a group or organization where work is done, where processes live, 
and where value is created by groups of people. 
* Connecting value creation to a context agent creates the ability to do the
accounting for a context.  
* A context agent can also create a membrane which deliniates different kinds of coordination of work 
within and between contexts.

A context agent can range from the tightest of traditional organizations to the loosest of networks.
We want to support value creation and accounting for all transitional and next economy experiments, 
from existing businesses to cooperatives to various P2P networks, and anything else people can imagine
where they want to associate with each other to create value. 

A context agent usually implies some level of self-governance within the group.
