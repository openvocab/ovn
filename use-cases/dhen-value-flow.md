#DHen value flow

[value flow report](http://dhen.webfactional.com/accounting/resource-flow-report/14/)

*(That's a table, we want a set of mini Sankey diagrams...)*

An example of an incoming value flow combining Exchanges and Processes. The numbers on the left are depth in a depth-first search starting from the end resource (pseudocode below).

```

### Agents involved

* Dancing Waters Permaculture Coop (group running the harvesting site, aka farm)
* Megan Pierce (person harvesting)
* Lauren McElroy (person harvesting)
* Namaste Lane Gardens (group running the drying site)
* Tea for the People (group selling the product)

### Detailed explaination

What's going on here, from beginning of flow to end (note only the catnip flow is displayed, nothing of reverse flows):
* Megan and Lauren both harvested catnip at Dancing Waters farm. (Process not recorded, no need.)
* There is a transfer from DW to each of them so they now own the catnip. (This is the 7 receipt, 8 exchange. They could pay the farm as part of this exchange, but in this case, they don't bother because they both live there.  And often the farms donate the herbs anyhow.)
* They each sold the catnip to Namaste Lane. (7 transfer, 6, 5. Two exchanges - only the transfer (receipt by NL) of the herbs shows in this directional sequence, the harvesters are either paid or owed money.)
* Namaste Lane combined the catnip into one lot and put it into the drying room (a process 3, with inputs 4 and 4, and output 2 resource production - this is where the lot number is created)
* When it got dry, it was removed from the drying room.  (Process not recorded.)
* When it comes out though, it also changes ownership - transfered from NL to Tea for People.  Still has the same lot number, but much less weight because it is dry. (Exchange 2 Transfer, and 1. Now it is just sitting in a storage room waiting to be sold.  Again reverse side of the exchange not shown.)

###Sequencing the flows (pseudocode):

```
resource = Catnip: 60915:
resource.depth_first_search():
    events = resource.all_economic_events()
    data = {} #a dictionary
    for event in events:
        prevs = event.previous_events() (which is not generally correct yet - more below)
        data[event] = prevs
    # Sequence events via topological sort, 
    # starting from events with no previous_events,
    # following the chain from previous to next event.
    event_sequence = toposort(data) 
    event_sequence.reverse()
    for event in event_sequence:
        if event.is_transfer():
            follow from transfer to exchange to reciprocal_transfer
        elif event.is_production():
            for input in event.process.inputs():
                input.resource.depth_first_search()
                
        
```
