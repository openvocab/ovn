We had an informal meeting today so we and Kalin could get to know each other better.

Vientos will first work on give/donate and borrow/lend.  No reciprocity yet.

In terms of coming focus, we want to:
* Get work, usage, service nailed down better in general
* ER use case (doctors available a whole shift; work on specific processes during the shift)
* Tool library a good use case for borrow/lend; Pavlik will start an issue
* Food hub interesting because we are or were working on food hubs/network software; usually the hub doesn't ever own the food, but provides logistics/admin/payment processing, etc. and can take a %
