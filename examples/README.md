This directory is deprecated.  Most of the yaml examples are now embedded into the example md/html, couldn't figure out how to include them in the mkdocs version.  There are some incomplete yaml examples here that are not in the VF doc.  TODO: Go through and delete examples that are in the VF doc, since they may not be the current version.  See if we want to keep the rest.


**Useful info: before doing a PR for an example:**

To validate YAML syntax, use `https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/#safeloadall-string--iterator--options- `.  Also works to use  `js-yaml filename`.

Validate all dates with `Data.parse()`
